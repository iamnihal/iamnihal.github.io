The moment you resist, you go against the natural flow of existence. When you resist anything or anyone in its true nature, you unknowingly build a cage within the realm of existence and this is where you've already lost the game.

Freedom lies in the absence of resistance, and the mantra should be to *'not invest in resistance'*. Solitude is found in experiencing the raw, being in tune with it rather than resisting its natural flow.

As [Bukowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bukowski) said:

> **"Don't Try."**

People often misinterpret those two words. They're not a call to nihilism but a Zen-like embrace of effortlessness, much like the principles of Taoism (one of my fav school of thought).
