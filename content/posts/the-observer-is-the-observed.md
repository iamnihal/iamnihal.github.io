People view the world through their own perceptions, and so they see nothing but *themselves*. There exists one single universal consciousness, within which our minds create our own little distinct identities to perceive the universe on our own terms.

When you become observant of your *self* and the totality of life, you begin to see how everything is connected and that none of us are truly different. It's all part of one system.

Realizing this softens judgement, because you understand that others are simply acting out their conditioning, just like we are. It grows compassion because if others are part of us in a deeper sense, how could we wish them harm?

One line I really like from [J. Krishnamurti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti) is:
> **"The observer is the observed."**

Succinct but profound!
