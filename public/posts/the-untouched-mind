Lately, something about kids is moving me. They carry an **unconditioned mind**, a **purity of consciousness**.

> If they’re angry, the anger is full.  
> If they’re joyful, the joy is complete.  
> If they’re curious, the curiosity has no end.  

Their innocence isn’t something they learn, it’s what consciousness looks like before it’s shaped by beliefs, identity, conditioning, and inherited thoughts.

As we grow, we accumulate layers of opinions, conditioning, expectations.
We stop seeing life directly and begin seeing it through a **borrowed lens**.
The simplicity we were born with gets buried beneath thought, *mostly without our awareness*.

Kids remind us of what remains beneath those layers: a clear, undivided awareness that experiences life *as it is*.

They don’t just reveal childhood, they reveal *our original state*.  
In Hindu philosophy, this is [**Sat-Chit-Ananda**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccid%C4%81nanda): pure existence, pure consciousness, pure bliss.

> **“A child is the closest thing to God.”**

Next time you see a child, don’t just look — truly [**observe!**](https://nihalchoudhary.in/posts/2025/04/the-observer-is-the-observed/).
